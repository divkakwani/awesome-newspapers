# How to contribute to Awesome Newspapers?

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. 

#### Ways To Contribute

* Update news sources:  Add news ones or fix issues in the existing sources
* Give a shout-out for this project

#### Updating News Sources

We are actively looking forward to receiving updates from the community and keeping this repo as updated as possible.  Feel free to raise a PR for the same. Do your best to follow these guidelines when submitting a PR. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good feedback:

* The PR should have the title: Update \<lang code\> sources
* It should make changes in exactly one language

Restricting updates to only one language per PR makes it easier for us to maintain the repository. We also understand that sometimes, when making bulk changes, a PR may need to update multiple languages - feel free to do so in that case. 

#### Shout-out for this Project

It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the repository from blog posts on the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter every time it has helped you, or simply star the repo to say "thank you".
